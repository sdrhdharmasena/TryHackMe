## üö® Troubleshooting

### Port 3000 Already in Use

If you get an error that port 3000 is busy:

**Option 1: Use a different port**
```bash
PORT=3001 npm start
```
Then access: http://localhost:3001

**Option 2: Kill the process using port 3000**
```bash
# On Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F

# On macOS/Linux
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
```

### Dependencies Installation Issues

If `npm install` fails:

1. **Clear npm cache:**
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

2. **Delete node_modules and reinstall:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

3. **Try with different registry:**
   ```bash
   npm install --registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
   ```

### Application Won't Start

If the application fails to start:

1. **Check Node.js version:**
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```
   Ensure it's version 14 or higher.

2. **Check for missing dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm list
   ```

3. **Look at error messages:**
   Read the terminal output carefully for specific error details.

4. **Restart with verbose logging:**
   ```bash
   DEBUG=* npm start
   ```

### Database Connection Issues

If you see database errors:

1. **The application uses in-memory database** - no external database required
2. **If issues persist, restart the application:**
   - Press Ctrl+C to stop
   - Run `npm start` again
