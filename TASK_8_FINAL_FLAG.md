## Questions, Answers & Hints

### Question 1

**Question:** Decode the Base64 string found in the secret file. What is the domain name in the decoded URL? (Format: xxx.xxxxxx.xxx)  
**Answer Format:** Text  
**Answer:** www.youtube.com  
**Points:** 25  
**Hint:** Use a Base64 decoder on the string found in file ID 5. Look for the domain name in the decoded URL structure.

### Question 2

**Question:** What is the video ID in the decoded YouTube URL? (The part after v=)  
**Answer Format:** Text  
**Answer:** dQw4w9WgXcQ  
**Points:** 20  
**Hint:** YouTube URLs typically follow the format youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID. Extract the alphanumeric string after the v= parameter.

### Question 3

**Question:** You've been tricked! What popular internet meme did you just encounter?  
**Answer Format:** Text (one word)  
**Answer:** Rickroll  
**Points:** 10  
**Hint:** This is a classic internet prank that became extremely popular in the 2000s. The video ID might give you a clue about what famous song and artist this references.

🎉 **Congratulations!** 🎉

You have successfully completed the BrewMaster Coffee Shop challenge! You've demonstrated skills in:

- Web application reconnaissance
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) exploitation
- NoSQL injection techniques
- JWT token analysis and manipulation
- Privilege escalation through token forgery
- Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) exploitation
- Data encoding/decoding
- Vulnerability chaining

**Total Points Earned:** 280

### Skills Practiced
✅ XSS Discovery and Exploitation  
✅ NoSQL Injection Attacks  
✅ JWT Security Analysis  
✅ Secret Extraction Techniques  
✅ Token Forgery and Privilege Escalation  
✅ IDOR Vulnerability Exploitation  
✅ Data Decoding and Analysis  
✅ Full Attack Chain Execution  

### Final Notes

This challenge demonstrated how multiple seemingly minor vulnerabilities can be chained together to achieve complete system compromise. In real-world scenarios, defense in depth is crucial - no single vulnerability should lead to total system takeover.

Remember: Never attempt these techniques on systems you don't own or have explicit permission to test!

**Happy Hacking!** ☕🔐
