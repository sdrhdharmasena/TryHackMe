# JWT and Authentication Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Admin Authentication (`routes/admin.js`)
- **Dual Token Support**: Now checks both cookies (`req.cookies.token`) and Authorization headers
- **Better Validation**: Added comprehensive token validation including expiration checks
- **Strict Admin Check**: Only allows users with role === 'admin' (not just any role)
- **Error Handling**: Clears invalid tokens and provides proper error messages

### 2. Updated Order Authentication (`routes/order.js`)
- **Consistent Auth**: Uses same dual token approach as admin routes
- **Token Validation**: Same comprehensive validation as admin routes
- **None Algorithm**: Supports 'none' algorithm for JWT bypass vulnerabilities

### 3. Enhanced App Middleware (`app.js`)
- **Global User Context**: Makes user data available to all views via `res.locals.user`
- **Dual Token Support**: Checks both cookies and Authorization headers
- **Expiration Handling**: Properly handles expired tokens
- **Vulnerable Configuration**: Supports 'none' algorithm for demo purposes

### 4. Server-Side Navbar (`views/partials/navbar.ejs`)
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Uses `res.locals.user` instead of client-side JavaScript
- **Conditional Content**: Shows admin links only for admin users
- **Clean Logout**: Proper logout functionality with server-side token clearing

### 5. Auth Route Enhancements (`routes/auth.js`)
- **Cookie Setting**: Sets both localStorage tokens and HTTP cookies
- **Comprehensive Logout**: Clears all token storage locations
- **Cross-Storage Support**: Supports both localStorage and cookie-based authentication

### 6. Auto-Authentication Script (`public/js/auth-sync.js`)
- **Token Synchronization**: Automatically syncs tokens between localStorage and cookies
- **Protected Route Handling**: Intercepts navigation to protected routes
- **Automatic Logout**: Handles expired tokens and logout functionality
- **Cross-Tab Sync**: Manages tokens across multiple browser tabs

### 7. New Checkout Functionality
- **Complete Checkout Page**: (`views/order/checkout.ejs`)
- **Order Success Page**: (`views/order/success.ejs`)
- **Auth-Protected**: Requires authentication to access

## Key Features

### Authentication Flow
1. **Login**: Sets both localStorage token and HTTP cookie
2. **Navigation**: Auth-sync script ensures tokens are available for server-side validation
3. **Validation**: Server checks both cookie and Authorization header
4. **Logout**: Clears all token storage locations

### Protected Routes
- `/admin/*` - Admin-only access
- `/order/checkout` - Authenticated users only
- `/order/place` - Authenticated users only

### Vulnerability Maintenance
- **NoSQL Injection**: Preserved in login routes
- **JWT None Algorithm**: Supported for bypass attacks
- **Clickjacking**: Admin pages still vulnerable (no X-Frame-Options)
- **Path Traversal**: File serving endpoint still vulnerable

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Admin Dashboard Access
```
1. Login as admin (username: admin, password: admin123)
2. Click "Admin Dashboard" in navbar dropdown
3. Should successfully access dashboard and see flag
4. Direct URL access (typing /admin/dashboard) should also work
```

### 2. Order/Checkout Flow
```
1. Login as any user
2. Add items to cart
3. Click "Checkout" - should access checkout page
4. Fill in customer information and place order
5. Should see success page with order details
```

### 3. Token Synchronization
```
1. Login in one tab
2. Open another tab - should automatically be logged in
3. Logout in one tab - other tab should sync logout
4. Tokens should work for both direct URL access and navbar navigation
```

## Browser Console Testing

The auth-sync script exposes several functions for testing:
- `window.clearAllTokens()` - Clear all tokens
- `window.validateTokens()` - Check token validity
- `window.syncTokenToCookie()` - Sync localStorage to cookie
- `window.performLogout()` - Complete logout process

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified:
- `routes/admin.js` - Enhanced admin authentication
- `routes/order.js` - Updated order authentication
- `app.js` - Global authentication middleware
- `views/partials/navbar.ejs` - Server-side navbar
- `routes/auth.js` - Cookie support and better logout
- `views/layout.ejs` - Cleanup and auth-sync inclusion

### Created:
- `public/js/auth-sync.js` - Auto-authentication script
- `views/order/checkout.ejs` - Checkout page
- `views/order/success.ejs` - Order success page

This implementation provides a robust JWT authentication system that supports both client-side (localStorage) and server-side (cookies) token storage while maintaining the intended security vulnerabilities for demonstration purposes.
