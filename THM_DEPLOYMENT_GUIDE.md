## Troubleshooting

### Port 3000 Already in Use

```bash
PORT=3001 npm start
```
Then access: http://localhost:3001

### Dependencies Installation Issues
If npm install fails:
```bash
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

### Application Won't Start
- Ensure Node.js is properly installed: `node --version`
- Check if all dependencies installed: `npm list`
- Look for error messages in the terminal

## Tools Recommendations
- **Burp Suite Community:** For request interception and modification
- **Browser Dev Tools:** For inspecting requests and manipulating storage
- **jwt.io:** For JWT token decoding and encoding
