## Task Content

### Introduction

Exploit the authentication system using NoSQL injection techniques.

### What You'll Learn

- NoSQL injection attacks
- Authentication bypass
- Request interception and modification

## Instructions üìã

Use Burp Suite to intercept login requests, test for NoSQL injection vulnerabilities, and target the user mentioned in Task 2.

2. **ÔøΩ Intercept Authentication Requests**
   ‚Ä¢ Navigate to the login page and attempt authentication
   ‚Ä¢ Capture the login request in Burp Suite
   ‚Ä¢ Analyze the request structure and format

## Expected Outcome ‚úÖ

Successfully bypass authentication and obtain privileged access with special keys.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Note

NoSQL injection can lead to authentication bypass, data extraction, and privilege escalation. Always ensure proper input validation and parameterized queries in production applications.

## Questions, Answers & Hints

### Question 1

**Question:** What is the username of the privileged user you discovered through NoSQL injection?  
**Answer Format:** Text  
**Answer:** admin  
**Points:** 20  
**Hint:** Use Burp Suite to intercept login requests. Target the user mentioned in the XSS alert from Task 2. Use MongoDB operators like $ne (not equal).

### Question 2

**Question:** What is the XSS key provided in the response after successfully targeting this user? (Format: XxxxxXxxxxxXxxxxxxXxxx)  
**Answer Format:** Text  
**Answer:** XssKeyForConfigAccess  
**Points:** 25  
**Hint:** After successfully performing NoSQL injection, examine the response body carefully. Look for a special key that might be used for XSS or further exploitation.
